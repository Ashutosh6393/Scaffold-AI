BLOCKED: test count dropped from $baseline to $current.

Tests are append-only within a slice. A test was deleted, skipped, or commented out.

If a test is genuinely wrong, that is a deliberate revision, not a repair:
  - only the test agent changes tests
  - log it in the Test revisions table in implementation.md with a justification
  - land it as its own commit
  - then re-baseline: bash .claude/hooks/check-test-count.sh --baseline

Restore the removed test(s) or record the revision before continuing.
